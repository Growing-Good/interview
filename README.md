## Exercise

You have been given a task to create a simple shopping cart application using React. The application should have the following features:

- A list of products with their names, prices, and an "Add to cart" button.

- A cart section that displays the selected items with their names, quantities, and total price.

- The ability to add and remove items from the cart.

- The ability to increase and decrease the quantity of items in the cart.

- The ability to clear the cart.

## Requirements

- Use React and any additional libraries you feel are necessary.

- Use `useContext` and `useReducer` to manage the state of the shopping cart.

- Use hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` as necessary.

- Use inline styles or a simple CSS file to style the application.

- The application should be completed within 1 hour.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your code will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Correctness of the implementation.

- Cleanliness and readability of the code.

- Proper use of React hooks

## Instructions

- You will be provided with a starter codebase that contains a `ProductList` component and a `Cart` component. You will need to create the `App` component that combines the two and manages the shopping cart state using `useContext` and `useReducer`.

- You may use any additional components, functions, or files that you need to complete the task.

- You may ask the interviewer any questions you have about the requirements or starter code.

- The interviewer will be available to answer any questions you have during the call.

- You will have 1 hour to complete the exercise.

## Getting Started

First install all of the packages

```bash

npm install

# or

yarn install

```

Then run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
